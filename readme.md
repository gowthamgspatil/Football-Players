## 📊 Dataset Features

Typical columns in a football player dataset include:

### **Player Details**

* Name
* Age
* Nationality
* Club
* Position

### **Attributes**

* Pace
* Shooting
* Passing
* Dribbling
* Defending
* Physicality
* Overall rating
* Potential rating

### **Market Info**

* Market value
* Wage
* Contract length

### **Performance Stats**

* Matches
* Goals
* Assists
* Clean sheets
* Cards

---

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis

The notebooks include:

* Rating distribution
* Club-wise player comparisons
* Attribute relationships
* Player value vs. rating
* Correlation heatmaps
* Identifying top players per position

---

## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

The following steps are applied:
